Full solution is in the "notebook.ipynb".
However, in order to carry out tests, code from notebook has been
copied over to functions.py and split into individual functions

# Install Requirements
- cd into the code directory

- Create a virtual env
`python3 -m venv .venv`

- Activate virtual env
`source source .venv/bin/activate`

- Run requirements
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Run from Notebook
- Run 
`jupyter notebook`

- Open notebook file

- Run all cells

## Run from terminal
Run `python functions.py`


## Run the tests
Run `pytest`
